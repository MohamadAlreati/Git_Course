BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

in the player class in both of the point and penalty methods we used the env.config to get the time to freeze.

in the delaer class we also used the env.config to aplly the timer which can be changed in the config properties file and also the warningTime.

in all of the methods that change the cards on the table (removeAllCardsFromTable , placeCradsOnTable) we used the env.config to check what is the size of the table which also can be changed in the config properties .

in the table the playersTokens array size is also taken from the env.config.



--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

in the dealer class , I made an array of players-threads , in the terminate method I terminated them starting from the array.length -1 index and went down until the first index (idx 0 ) .

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
